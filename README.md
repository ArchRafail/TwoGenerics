# TwoGenerics</br>

</br>
</br>
The task was the next:</br>
Most functions in programming languages may return just only one value of object.</br>
But, in our case, we have to return values of two objects.</br>
Anyway, we don't want to create wrapper class for only these two objects.</br>
As we need to create wrapper class, we will create class that contains 2 jenerics.</br>
Realize wrapper class with name Tuple<T, K> with TDD process of developing!</br>
</br>
</br>
Program requirements:</br>
1. Class must be wrapper for two generics type, what we have be able to set/get.</br>
2. The ability to create object of our class with constructor must to be prohibited.</br>
3. Creating the object of class can be done with static method OF from one of three options.</br>
4. Three options of method OF should be realized according to comfortable work with our class.</br>
